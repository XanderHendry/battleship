**BattleShip!** 
*the classic strategy game where you set out to destroy your oppenents fleet before they destroy yours!*
game will start with the Main Menu, prompting the user to enter P to play, C for a custom game, or Q to quit.
if you choose to C
you go into a customization menu asking if you want to customize the board size, or create custome ships!
answer with Y or N
*setup*
the computer will place their ships first, and then you will be prompted to place yours.
enter coordinates in the format of:
A1 A2 A3
The board will render after each ship is places, showing it's position.
once all boards are placed the game will start!
*playing the game*
The User and the Computer will take turns firing at coordinates, whoever sinks the others ships first wins!
enter your coordinates in the format of 
A1
the board will render after each shot, and you will recieve feedback on whether it was a hit, a miss, or if you sunk a ship!
once a players ships has reached 0, the game will declare the winner, and end.

### Written Reflection
1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration     3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
    we made a started with a slack huddle, where we brainstormed possible approaches and needed classes. Once we decided on what objects we would need we began writing all the tests that and making a runner file for those that we couldn't. We updated the tests as needed as we realized that some of the functions we originally thought would go in one class, ended up in another.
2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
   If we had one more day I probably could have finished a ==Hard== mode for the AI, and we also thought it would be cool to bundle the program into a gem, but we didn't have the idea early enough
3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
  Pairing techniques used for this project -
  We mostly used a form of pairing that was similar to driver navigator. One team member would write code they thought would work, and     then we would troubleshoot as a pair.
  We did use driver navigator on occasion when it was called for - the driving partner might get stuck on a bit of code with no ideas,     and the observer would have an idea.
  Over half of the work was done asynchronously, or written in parallel while in a slack huddle so the members could "rubber duck" each     other, or so good ideas could be implemented into the code on the first pass instead of the second.
4 .Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
   we shared feedback right after accomplishments. Whenever there was a pull request or whenever we shared a feature we gave eachother feedback. It was 99% positive, so it wasn't very difficult, we both gave ourselves a bit more negative feedback so the other didn't have to. We also gave eachother live feedback during paired sessions, by commenting or challenging eachothers approaches, or simply asking for an explanation.
